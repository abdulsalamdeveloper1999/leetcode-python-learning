# LeetCode Python - Top 50 Problems

This repository contains my solutions to the top 50 most important LeetCode problems in Python, following the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule). These problems cover the most common patterns and concepts that appear in coding interviews.

## Learning Approach

I follow a structured learning approach for each problem:
1. Understanding the problem thoroughly
2. Developing thought process step by step
3. Writing solution with detailed comments
4. Learning from edge cases and optimizations

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by problem patterns:

```
├── Arrays_and_Hashing
├── Two_Pointers
├── Sliding_Window
├── Stack
├── Binary_Search
├── Trees
└── Graphs
```
